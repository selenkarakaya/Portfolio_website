              I graduated at 2017 from university and I worked at companies as
              geomatics engineer. When I started my master's degree I decided to
              combine Software Engineering and Geomatics engineer. I focused on
              deep learning and remote sensing. During the my master's degree, I
              realized that I like to lost in code more than measure, design,
              develop systems for collecting and analyzing spatial information
              about the enviroment. I said to myself "Why am I not a software
              engineer? " however I did not dare to change my career and leave
              my academia, friends, professors and students.
            </p> -->
            <!-- <p class="text-start">
              After moved to UK, I said that new life new career and I started
              to Become a FrontEnd Developer. I got courses and I designed 3
              diffrent project with I learned. It's never to late change to
              career, I found the profession that will make me happy. Now I am
              on the bottom rung but I want to improve myself and move forward
              with software engineer. There are a lot of topics to learn, I am
              here and ready!

              When I’m not at the computer, I’m usually running, exercising,

              Hi there! I’m Selen Karakaya, a dedicated and curious Front-End
              Developer with a unique journey into tech. My career began as a
              Geomatics Engineer, where I honed my skills in spatial analysis
              and system development. While pursuing my Master’s in Science and
              Engineering, I discovered my passion for coding and software
              development, particularly through projects that combined deep
              learning and remote sensing.
            </p>
            <p class="text-start">
              During this time, I realized I enjoyed immersing myself in code
              more than designing and analyzing spatial systems. Despite my love
              for academia and the professional relationships I’d built, I knew
              I wanted a career that would truly ignite my enthusiasm. Moving to
              the UK marked a fresh chapter in my life, and I decided to embrace
              my calling as a Front-End Developer.
            </p>
            <p class="text-start">
              Since then, I’ve completed specialized courses, worked on several
              dynamic web projects, and cultivated a robust skill set in HTML,
              CSS, JavaScript, React, and more. From creating responsive user
              interfaces to integrating APIs, I’m passionate about building
              accessible and engaging web applications that make a difference.
            </p>
            <p class="text-start">
              When I’m not coding, you can find me running, practicing Pilates,
              exploring new hobbies, or enjoying quality time with my husband.
              My journey has taught me it’s never too late to pursue what makes
              you happy, and I’m excited to continue growing and contributing as
              a developer.
